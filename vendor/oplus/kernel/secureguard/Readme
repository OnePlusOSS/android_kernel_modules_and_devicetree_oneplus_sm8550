Oplus Kernel Security Reinforcement Solution.

=======
On the baseline of Android S, 3sets of codes are prepared here because of GKI.
1.gki1.0
This is the early source code of ROOT_CHECK, which meets the requirements of GKI1.0,and is
suitable for projects before Android S or that does NOT require GKI2.0 requirements. (Consider
 the compatibility risk, remproarily save this code to s/master.)
2.gki2.0
The project transformed by GKI2.0 is suitable for projects after Android S.

Note:
Subsequent addition of new security policies will give priority to updating the code of GKI2.0. 
If the version before GKI2.0 is no longer used after Android S, the GKI1.0 will not be updated
 at the same time.
