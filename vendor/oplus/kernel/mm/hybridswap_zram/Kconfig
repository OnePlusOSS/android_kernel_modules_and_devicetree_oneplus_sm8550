	  Creates virtual block devices called /dev/zramX (X = 0, 1, ...).
	  Pages written to these disks are compressed and stored in memory
	  itself. These disks allow very fast I/O and compression provides
	  good amounts of memory savings.

	  It has several use cases, for example: /tmp storage, use as swap
	  disks and maybe many more.

	  See Documentation/admin-guide/blockdev/zram.rst for more information.

config HYBRIDSWAP_ZRAM_WRITEBACK

       help
	 With incompressible page, there is no memory saving to keep it
	 in memory. Instead, write it out to backing device.
	 For this feature, admin should set up backing device via
	 /sys/block/zramX/backing_dev.

	 With /sys/block/zramX/{idle,writeback}, application could ask
	 idle page's writeback to the backing device to save in memory.

	 See Documentation/admin-guide/blockdev/zram.rst for more information.

	help
	  zsmalloc is a slab-based memory allocator designed to store
	  compressed RAM pages.  zsmalloc uses virtual memory mapping
	  in order to reduce fragmentation.  However, this results in a
	  non-standard allocator interface where a handle, not a pointer, is
	  returned by an alloc().  This handle must be mapped in order to
	  access the allocated space.

	  With this feature, admin can track the state of allocated blocks
	  of zRAM. Admin could see the information via
	  /sys/kernel/debug/zram/zramX/block_state.

	  See Documentation/admin-guide/blockdev/zram.rst for more information.

	  swapd is a kernel thread that reclaim anonymous pages in the

	  and the refault of anonymous pages is high, the content of
	  zram will exchanged to eswap by a certain percentage.

	  If unsure, say N here.
	  This module can't be compiled as a module,
